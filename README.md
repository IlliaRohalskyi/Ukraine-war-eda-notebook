In this notebook I analyzed losses of Russian armed forces. I made interactive graphs that show losses on day to day basis. I also have analyzed greatest losses directions. This project was made to show how much Russia loses in this war. They lose not only their equipment, but also lots of people from their side, which is far more important. I condem Russian agression and crimes they do on Ukrainian land. Glory to Ukraine and to its people
